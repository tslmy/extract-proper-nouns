            <span>Computer science</span> is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications. 
            It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or <span>algorithms</span>) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of <span>automating algorithmic processes</span> that scale. A <span>computer scientist</span> specializes in the theory of computation and the design of <span>computational systems</span>. -- From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
